# amountPay
A C program that calculates your weekly pay.

In this challenge I'm gonna create a C program capable of calculating my weekly pay.

The program should ask the user to input their number of hours worked in a week via keyboard.
Then the program should output the gross pay, the taxes and net pay.

The following assumptions will be made:
  - Basic pay rate = 12$/hr
  - Overtime (in excess of 40 hours a week) = time and half
  - Tax rate: 
      - 15% for the first 300$
      - 20% of the next 200$
      - 25% of the rest
